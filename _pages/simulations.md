## Branched Cylinders: Dendritic Tree Approximations
Explored some of the time independent electrical properties of single branched cables. Branched cables are an important means of modelling the passive electrical properties of axonal and dendritic trees. For convenience, trees exhibiting only one order of branching were considered. Nevertheless, the principles could be easily extended to higher order trees.

In the above diagram, V~1~,V~21~ and V~22~ are the membrane potentials of the respective branches. d~1~, d~21~ and d~22~ are the diameters of the parent and daughter branches respectively and X is axial distance in terms of the dimensionless electrotonic distance X = x/&lambda~c~.

By solving the differential equations with the given nodal and boundary conditions, steady-state voltage profile in each branch could be determined.
