<div style="text-align: justify; width: 800px">
I am a Graduate Research Intern at the Bioinformatics Institute, Singapore. Currently, I am working on Multi-instance Learning and Multi-task Learning based models for Computational Pathology, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=9ebsWAoAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Lee Hwee Kuan </a>. My current research interests lie in structured sparsity, compressed sensing and inverse problems in imaging, for which I am remotely collaborating with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=xplw9-gAAAAJ">Prof. Marco F. Duarte </a>. More broadly, I am keen on optimization and statistical learning theory. By exploiting my theoretical knowledge, I engaged in projects spanning aspects of research, including data analysis, formulating an optimization objective, algorithm design, verification and hardware implementation.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
	I completed my Bachelors in Engineering with First Class Honors with the gold medal for my cohort at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering (ENTC), and the gold medal from the Faculty of Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. My final year thesis project was on "Optical microscopy optimisation through compressive sensing and reconstruction" under the supervision of <a href="https://centerforadvancedimaging.harvard.edu/people/dushan-wadduwage-phd/">Dr. Dushan Wadduwage</a> and <a href= "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qe5byo4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. Chamira Edussooriya</a>. This research project was a part of a collaboration with the <a href="https://wadduwagelab.github.io/">Wadduwage lab</a> at the Centre for Advanced Imaging at Harvard University. I have worked in physics-based human motion prediction in the University of Sydney, Australia during my internship with <a href= "https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=y17ckyIAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Anusha Withana</a>. Further, as self-initiated research projects, I have worked on point cloud segmentation using Graph Neural Networks with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YaEJbvYAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Ranga Rodrigo</a>, and channel estimation and RIS configuration search with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=4-S204cAAAAJ">Dr. Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa</a>.
